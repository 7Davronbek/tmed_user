In Tashkent, Ashgabat, Karshi, Charjou, Krasnovodsk, Samarkand, Chernyayevo, Kizilarvat stations, first general, then special (therapy, surgery, infection, maternity) hospital departments were established. In 1918, 185 boats were laid, 1306 in 1940, 1890 in 1950, and more than 3000 boats by 1968. In 1929, polyclinics and health centers were reorganized.
