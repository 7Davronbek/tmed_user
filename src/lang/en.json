In Tashkent, Ashgabat, Karshi, Charjou, Krasnovodsk, Samarkand, Chernyayevo, Kizilarvat stations, first general, then special (therapy, surgery, infection, maternity) hospital departments were established. In 1918, 185 boats were laid, 1306 in 1940, 1890 in 1950, and more than 3000 boats by 1968. In 1929, polyclinics and health centers were reorganized.

In order to bring medical care closer to railway workers living on the line, the \"Salamtlik\" medical-sanitary aid train has been established, which includes two ambulatory cars with doctors' rooms, procedures, registers and diagnostic rooms, fluorograph cars, and sleeping cars for employees. On the \"Salamatlik\" train, all conditions have been created for medical staff to work in small stations, to conduct medical examinations of railway workers living in places far from the hospitals of the Central District.",
